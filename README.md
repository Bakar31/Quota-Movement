## Bangladesh Quota Movement Casualty Tracker

This project aimed to develop an application for documenting and tracking casualties during the Bangladesh Quota Movement in July. Unfortunately, the project remained incomplete due to the government-imposed internet shutdown at the time.

Despite not being able to finish it, I am glad to see that other engineers have successfully developed similar applications to serve this important purpose.
